<h1>Aliah's Favourite Movies of All Time</h1>
<h2>Not just my favourite movies but the actual best movies of all time. If you don't think so...you're wrong.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>1. Harry Potter Series</h3>
<p>Honestly, need I say more? Magical, spell-binding and just brings you into another world.</p>

<h3>2. Inception</h3>
<p>Messes with your mind in a good way! Was rethinking the ending and looking for theories for days after.</p>

<h3>3. Grease</h3>
<p>I don't quite know why this movie has a chokehold on me. But I truly love and look forward to this movie when it's on! Tunes and grooves all round.</p>
