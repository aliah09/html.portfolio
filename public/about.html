<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Aliah. I have a background in pharmacy and teaching. Interestingly enough, I'm looking into a completely
  new field - software development.
</p>

<p>I've learnt so many invaluable experiences as a pharmacist and a teacher and while some people might think that it's yet another
  big change, I'm confident I know myself well. I know what I don't want and I'm not afraid to keep discovering what suits me!
</p>

<p>There's a lot of uncertainty in the future but trajectory doesn't change if you stay in the same lane! I'm confident I'll be able
  to find that right job for me and I hope this is it!
